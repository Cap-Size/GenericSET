# This is *Generic SET*, the greatest thing since sliced **Bread**.
This is a tool to pull site html code, rewrite the bits that contain references to the subdirectories and write them to their url counterpart. In the final stages, the tool should be able to take the input means and log them while passing them to the actual functions they are referenced to.

### Road map
1. ~~Pull html~~
1. Change the reference links to resources
1. Change intput means to connect to other resources
1. Recursion through the sites sub pages
1. Micro server backend that will host the site and store the input attempts
